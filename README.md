# My Talks

I am not a professional speaker and I dislike doing it just like you do.  Why do it?

* I have benefitted greatly from the contributions of others; We all have an obligation to give back
* I believe challenging myself will lead to more growth
* I want to see engineers I work with on the stage; I feel like I need to set a positive example
